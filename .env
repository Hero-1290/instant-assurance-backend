### **Step 2: Install New Python Library**

Your Python script now needs to make HTTP requests to the flight API. We'll use the standard `requests` library for this.

**Action:**
1.  Go to the terminal for your backend Codespace.
2.  Make sure your virtual environment is activated if you are using one.
3.  Run the following command to install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install requests python-dotenv
